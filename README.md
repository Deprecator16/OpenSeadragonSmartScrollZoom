# OpenSeadragonSmartScrollZoom
This is a small, simple plugin for OpenSeadragon, which detects how fast the user is scrolling the mouse wheel and increases the zoom speed accordingly.

Download and include `openseadragon-smartScrollZoom.js` after OpenSeadragon on your website.

To use this plugin, include this after declaring a viewer instance:
`````javascript
viewer.smartScrollZoom({
  //Define your properties here
  minScrolls: ...,
  ...
});
`````
It would look something like this:
`````javascript
//Create Viewer object
var viewer = new OpenSeadragon(...);

//Define smartScrollZoom for this viewer
viewer.smartScrollZoom({
  minWidth: ...,
  pixelsPerMeter: ...,
  color: ...,
  ...
});
`````

## Properties
Here's a list of the properties that can be defined, taken directly from the source code:
1. timeThreshold {Number} - Amount of time, in milliseconds, that the minimum number of scrolls must occur within before logic begins.

2. minScrolls {Number} - Required number of consecutive scrolls that must take place within the specified time threshold of each other before logic begins.

3. minZoomPerScroll {Number} - Minimum factor to zoom by with a single scroll. Setting this to 1 will affectively result in no zoom while logic is not being executing.

4. maxZoomPerScroll {Number} - Maximum zoom factor that can be reached.

5. zoomIncrement {Number} - Amount to increment zoom factor by with every scroll after minScrolls
